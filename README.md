# calc-app

I made this with
<ul>
  <li>React (Front-End Framework)</li>
  <li>Sass (Styling)</li>
  <li>Redux (State Storage)</li>
  <li>Nerdamer (Calculation Package)</li>
</ul>

to help me learn React.js

Next Plan:

1. Adding Delete Key
2. Adding Session Storage For Calculator Output
3. Making RWD to desktop
4. Making More Complex Calc Key with Nerdamer
